Automatically ReleaseDevice when application disconnects from bus

 only allow GetVerifyResult during a verification
 only allow VerifyStop during a verification
 etc

- Make storage per-manager
- Move storage setting to a configuration file
- Kill FromStorage variants, we should always load/read from our custom storage
