This file lists notable changes in each release. For the full history of all
changes, see ChangeLog.

Version 1.90.6:

The 1.90.5 release was unusable due to a number of inter-related issues
with the DBus interface and authorization. We also found a number of
problems with possible security implications.

Currently fprintd will do interactive authorization even if this was not
requested using the correct DBus method call flag. All API users MUST be
updated to set the flag as it will be enabled in the future!

Highlights:
 - Fix fprintd DBus configuration
 - Change details of what requires authorization
 - Fix various race conditions in pam_fprintd
 - Permit interactive authorization from fprintd utilities
 - Do not allow deletion while another operation is ongoing


Version 1.90.5:

The 1.90.4 release contained some bad errors, this release addresses those.

Highlights:
 - Permit building with polkit older than 0.114
 - Fix possible issues with PAM test
 - Fix incorrect DBus policy
 - Fix build so that CFLAGS enviroment is correctly used
 - Skip hotplug test with older libfprint (which times out otherwise)

Version 1.90.4:

This fprintd release contains major core reworkings and improved testing.
As such, only the most important changes are listed here, focusing on
changes relevant to distributors.

Highlights:
 - Authentication is now required to enroll a new print (#5)
 - Add support for the libfprint early reporting mechanism
 - Proper hotplug support together with libfprint 1.90.4
 - Handle STATE_DIRECTORY containing multiple paths

version 1.90.1:
- Add support for prints saved on the fingerprint device itself
- Add integration tests using the virtual image driver, and further
  tests for the utilities
- Port build system to meson
- Loads of build warnings and memory leak fixes

- PAM module:
  - Port PAM module to sd-bus from dbus-glib
  - Use systemd to not ask for a fingerprint scan on remote logins
  - Add man page for PAM module
  - Add tests
